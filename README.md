# Pathfinding Visualizer 2
This application is a tool for visualizing pathfinding and maze generation algorithms (maze generation has not been added yet). I built the original version of this project in December 2021 using JavaScript. This is an improved version and will be the main repository for the project going forward. You can try the version of the project [here](https://landoniwnl.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/).

# Inspriation
This project was inspired by the pathfinding visualizer made by Cl√©ment Mihailescu. You can find his source code [here](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer). I also referenced a visualizer made by Hisham Maged when developing this project which you can view [here](https://github.com/hisham-maged10/path-finder).

# Future Plans
Currently, this visualizer only implements breadth-first-search. I plan to add a number of features to this visualizer including more pathfinding algorithms and some maze generation algorithms.
