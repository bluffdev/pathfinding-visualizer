# Pathfinding Visualizer 2
This is a pathfinding visualizer built with TypeScript. It is an improved version of the one I made recently and is inspired by the pathfinding visualizer made by Cl√©ment Mihailescu. You can find his source code [here](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer).

# Future Plans
Currently, this visualizer only implements breadth-first-search. I plan to add a number of features to this visualizer including more pathfinding algorithms and some maze generation algorithms.
